This one of my first projects, the language is swedish but the 
code can still be understand by english speakers. This is a project 
from school created in the very first few weeks.

These new changes I made because back when this was created I didn't 
know much about web development. Some of these changes are code names
and fixed stuff that was forgotten in the original build.

In the InfoToAssignment folder there is pitcures of the site that I'm 
cloning.
